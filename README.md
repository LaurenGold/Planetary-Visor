# Planetary-Visor
## About
Planetary Visor is our virtual reality tool to visualize orbital and rover-based datasets the ongoing traverse of the NASA Curiosity rover in Gale Crater. Data from orbital spectrometers provide insight about the composition of planetary terrains. Meanwhile, Curiosity rover data provide fine-scaled localized information about Martian geology.
By visualizing the intersection of the orbiting instrument's field of view with the rover-scale topography, and providing interactive navigation controls, Visor constitutes a platform for users to intuitively understand the scale and context of the Martian geologic data under scientific investigation.
